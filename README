# Enhanced_Face_and_Eye_Detection_in_Real_Time_Using_Haarcascades_in_OpenCV

## Overview

This project implements real-time face and eye detection using Haar Cascade classifiers in OpenCV. It captures video from a file and detects faces in each frame. For each detected face,
it further identifies and marks the eyes within the face region.

## Project Background

This project was developed as part of my internship at Innovate Intern. The goal was to gain practical experience in computer vision and image processing techniques, 
specifically focusing on facial feature detection. Face and eye detection are fundamental tasks in computer vision with applications ranging from security systems to human-computer interaction.

## Features

- Real-time detection of faces and eyes in video streams.
- Display of rectangles around detected faces (blue) and eyes (green) in the video feed.
- Integration of Haar Cascade classifiers for efficient object detection.

## Requirements

- Python 3
- OpenCV library (`cv2`)
- Haar Cascade XML files for face and eye detection
